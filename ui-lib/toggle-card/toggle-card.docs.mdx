description: A custom toggle card that has the same behaviour as MUI's ToggleButton.
---

This component is pretty much a custom `ToggleButton` to fit our needed behaviour and styling.

### Component usage

```js
<ToggleCard value="one">One</ToggleCard>
// Or
<ToggleCard value="mongo">
  <MongoIcon fontSize='large' sx={{ mr: 1 }} />
  <Typography variant='body1'>MongoDB</Typography>
</ToggleCard>
```
